Alignment has 2000 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 32.17%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 2 non-parametric bootstrap inferences

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
